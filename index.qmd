# Ruitian Liu

I am a graduate student in the Department of Statistics at the University of California, Davis, where I began my M.S. in Statistics in 2025. Prior to that, I earned my B.S. in Statistics from North China Institute of Science and Technology between 2021-2025. 

## Academic interests 
- Model selection (bias-variance trade-off, misspecified model, sampling)
- Functional/longitudinal data analysis (FPCA, functional regression, design of experiments)
- Bayesian inference (high dimensional problem, prior selection)
- Applications to scientific and real world problem (natural disaster, social science)

## Current Work
- Functional data analysis of typhoon intensity & tracks in western north pacific
- Analysis and imputation of missing data under AR(1) setting
- Prior selection for bayesian regression
