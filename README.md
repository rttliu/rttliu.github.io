# Ruitian Liu – Academic Website

Please see details accordinhg to my academic website: https://rttliu.github.io/

The website and the repository contains the source code for my personal academic information, built with Quarto and hosted via GitHub Pages. The site documents my coursework, research projects, technical writing, and CV as a Statistics M.S. student at UC Davis. 

It includes pages on completed and ongoing coursework, research projects, selected notes, and a downloadable CV. Some materials are actively maintained, and additional content is currently being prepared and will be posted progressively as projects and writing are finalized. All pages are rendered to the `docs/` directory for deployment.
